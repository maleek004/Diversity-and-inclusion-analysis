# HR Data Analysis for Virtual Telecoms Company

## Project Overview
This project involved analyzing HR data for a virtual telecoms company as part of PWCâ€™s virtual PowerBI internship on Forage. The goal was to create a comprehensive report focusing on gender-related Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to assess and improve diversity and inclusion within the company.

## Objectives
- Analyze HR data to identify trends and insights related to gender balance.
- Define and measure KPIs related to hiring, promotion, performance, and turnover.
- Create a multi-page report with intuitive navigation and clear visualizations.
- Provide actionable insights to address diversity and inclusion challenges.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft PowerBI**

## Skills and Techniques Demonstrated
- **Defining KPIs:** I developed relevant KPIs to measure gender balance and diversity within the organization.
- **Data Visualization:** I created effective visualizations to represent HR data clearly and accurately.
- **Data Transformation:** I utilized Power Query editor for data cleaning and transformation.
- **Multi-Page Report Building:** I designed a multi-page report with proper navigation for easy exploration of data.
- **Report Writing:** I wrote a precise and comprehensive report detailing my findings and recommendations.

## Key Achievements
- **KPI Definition and Visualization:** I successfully defined and visualized KPIs related to hiring, promotion, performance, and turnover, focusing on gender balance .
- **Comprehensive Report:** I authored a detailed report identifying root causes of the company's slow progress towards diversity and inclusion, offering actionable recommendations.

## Report Highlights
- **Age Group on Female Turnover:** Analysis reveals a notably higher percentage of female attrition in the age group 40-49. Encouraging female workers in this age range to remain employed longer is recommended. Alternatively, the proportion of female leavers in the age group 20-29 is low, suggesting that hiring more women in this age bracket could lead to decreased turnover. Additionally, there are no female employees in the age group 60-69, as almost all females leave the company between the ages of 40 and 59.
- **Difference in Number of Male to Female in Hiring:** An evaluation of the last hiring cycle indicates no significant disparities in the number of male and female hires. Thirty-32 males and 34 females were recruited. However, there is a **discernible trend of hiring more men for higher-level positions**, such as Director, Senior Manager, and Executive, while a greater percentage of women were hired for lower-level positions, such as Junior Officer, Senior Officer, and Manager.
- **Gender Difference in Promotion:** A significantly higher percentage of male employees (65%) received promotions during the FY21 period. Furthermore, the average rating of these male employees who received promotions (1.97) was higher than that of their female counterparts (1.78).
- **Gender Split Across All Job Levels After Last Hiring Round:** Despite a slightly higher percentage of female hires in the previous year, there are roughly equal numbers of male and female employees at the Junior Officer and Senior Officer job levels. There is a considerable gender imbalance in favor of males at all higher job levels, with more men hired directly into these levels than women in the previous year.
- **Gender Split Across Departments:** Our analysis indicates that male employees dominate four of the six departments in the company (Sales & Marketing, Internal Services, Strategy, and Finance). Meanwhile, female employees dominate in only one department (HR) and have an equal representation with males in the Operations department.

## Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into the HR dynamics of the virtual telecoms company, emphasizing the importance of gender balance and diversity. By defining relevant KPIs and visualizing key metrics, the report also offers a clear roadmap for improving diversity and inclusion efforts.
